The usual procedure for detecting them is looking for bands with\r\na large projection around the atoms at the surface or defect. This\r\nprocedure is both cumbersome for the user and error-prone. For instance,\r\nthe lowest unoccupied levels of the neutral C\\$\\_N\\$ defect in h-BN has\r\npractically no projection on the defect atom and its nearest neighbors.\r\nThis delayed its identification as a single-photon\r\nemitter.cite{jara2021,auburger2021} A much simpler way to detect these\r\nlocalized levels is by means of the extit{Inverse Participation Ratio},\r\ndefined as\r\n\r\n$$IPR_{nk} = \frac{\\sum_{a} |c_{nki}|^4}{\\left(\\sum_a c_{nka}ight)^2}$$\r\n\r\nwhere the indexes \\$n,k,a\\$ are the band, k-point and atom,\r\nrespectively. This function has been extensively applied in the context\r\nof Anderson localization.cite{Evers2000} However, can capture any kind\r\nof localization. A perfectly localized state - extit{i.e.} localized in\r\na single atom- would have \\$IPR=1\\$, but a fully extended state has\r\n\\$IPR=\frac{1}{N}\\$, with \\$N\\$ the total number of atoms.\r\n\r\n# Preparation\r\n\r\nBefore diving into plotting, we need to download the example files.

Its ground state is a\r\ntriplet, allowing the control of the spin by microwave\r\nradiation.cite{DOHERTY2013} The energy levels of a diamond supercell\r\nhosting the defect are in Fig.\\~ref{fig:ipr}b. The supercell has 215\r\natoms, hence \\$IPRto 0\\$ for bulk states (blue lines). Several defect\r\nlevels lie within the fundamental band gap of diamond (dark red lines).\r\nThe closest levels to the Fermi energy are double degenerate\r\n(textit{i.e.} triplet), but only occupied for the spin majority. Hence,\r\naccording to the optical transition takes place between the bands with\r\nindex \\$430to 431\\$ or \\$430to432\\$ of the spin channel labelled\r\n\\`spin-1\\'. The calculation of the main emission line involves a\r\ncalculation of the excited state, which can be simulated by fixing the\r\noccupations of the mentioned levels, textit{i.e.} the\r\n\\$Delta\\$SCFmethod.cite{Jin2021} The pyprocar code is:\r\n"
