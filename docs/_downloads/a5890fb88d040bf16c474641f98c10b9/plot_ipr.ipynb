        "# Plotting Inverse participation ratio {#ref_plot_ipr}\r\n\r\nOften it is needed to search for **localized** modes within the band\r\nstructure, typical examples are surface/interface states and defect\r\nlevels. The usual procedure for detecting them is looking for bands with\r\na large projection around the atoms at the surface or defect. This\r\nprocedure is both cumbersome for the user and error-prone. For instance,\r\nthe lowest unoccupied levels of the neutral $C_N$ defect in h-BN has\r\npractically no projection on the defect atom and its nearest neighbors.\r\nThis delayed its identification as a single-photon\r\nemitter.\\[jara2021,auburger2021\\] A much simpler way to detect these\r\nlocalized levels is by means of the **Inverse Participation Ratio**,\r\ndefined as\r\n\r\n$$IPR_{nk} = \\frac{\\sum_{a} |c_{nki}|^4}{\\left(\\sum_a c_{nka}\\right)^2}$$\r\n\r\nwhere the indexes $n,k,a$ are the band, k-point and atom, respectively.\r\nThis function has been extensively applied in the context of Anderson\r\nlocalization.\\[Evers2000\\] However, can capture any kind of\r\nlocalization. A perfectly localized state -**i.e.** localized in a\r\nsingle atom- would have $IPR=1$, but a fully extended state has\r\n$IPR=\\frac{1}{N}$, with $N$ the total number of atoms.\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\n\r\nBefore diving into plotting, we need to download the example files. Use\r\nthe following code to do this. Once downloaded, specify the\r\n[data_dir]{.title-ref} to point to the location of the downloaded data.\r\n\r\n``` {caption=\"Downloading example\"}\r\nimport pyprocar\r\n\r\nbi2se3_data_dir = pyprocar.download_example(\r\n                            save_dir='', \r\n                            material='Bi2Se3-spinorbit-surface',\r\n                            code='vasp', \r\n                            spin_calc_type='spin-polarized-colinear',\r\n                            calc_type='bands'\r\n                            )\r\n```\r\n"
