Contributing
==================================

We absolutely welcome contributions and we hope that this guide will
facilitate an understanding of the PyProcar code repository. It is
important to note that the PyProcar software package is maintained on a
volunteer basis and thus we need to foster a community that can support
user questions and develop new features to make this software a useful
tool for all users.

This page is dedicated to outline where you should start with your
question, concern, feature request, or desire to contribute.

Being Respectful
-----------------------------------

Please demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people, other software,
and the communities who have worked diligently to build (un-)related tools.

Please do not talk down in Pull Requests, Issues, or otherwise in a way that
portrays other people or their works in a negative light.

Cloning the Source Repository
-----------------------------------

You can clone the source repository from
`<https://github.com/romerogroup/pyprocar>`_ and install the latest version by
running:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/romerogroup/pyprocar.git
   cd pyprocar
   python -m pip install -e .
   git checkout dev


Updating documentation
-----------------------------------

The documentation for pyprocar are generated by using sphinx and the sphinx-gallery packages. 
If you add code to the package, make sure to add the proper doc strings to be automatically generated.

To generate the documentation you will need to run the following code from the top-level directory:

.. code:: bash

   cd sphinx
   make clean & make html

This will clean the sphinx/_build directory which contained the previous html, then it will generate the new documentation in sphinx/_build/html.


Running tests 
-----------------------------------

In the current version of pyprocar, we have added to external tests to test the functionality of the package. 
To do this you will need to download the development data by running the following code.

.. code:: python

   import pyprocar
   pyprocar.download_dev_data()

This will download the development data to pyprocar/data/examples.

Now to run the tests, from the top directory run pytest
